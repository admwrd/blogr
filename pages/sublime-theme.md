# Sublime Text
I use Sublime Text as my programming editor of choice while using Windows. On linux I usually use VS Code.   I am still working out the kinks on the VS Code version; but know the two will never be the same.

If you like it you are free to use, modify, and distribute it; I only ask you keep the original comments and author statement.  You can download the file here:

When I tweak the VS Code theme a little more I will add the link to that as well.
