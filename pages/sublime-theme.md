# Sublime Text
I use Sublime Text as my programming editor of choice while using Windows. On linux I usually use VS Code.   I am still working out the kinks on the VS Code version; but keep in mind that the two versions will never be the same.

<div class="img-wrap-center">
<a data-fancybox="gallery" href="{{base_url}}uploads/sublime-rust-theme.PNG"><img alt="My Rust theme for Sublime Text" src="{{base_url}}uploads/sublime-rust-theme.PNG"></a>
</div>

If you like it you are free to use, modify, and distribute it; I only ask you keep the original comments and author statement.  You can download the file here:

When I tweak the VS Code theme a little more I will add the link to that as well.
