# Website Details
This blog was written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) using the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework.  See [About Me]({{base_url}}content/about-me) for a list of tools I use and information about me.

#### Software And Services
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) - Using it as a reverse proxy to forward requests to my blog web app, while also serving static files.
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - Can't beat free.
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=b0738c61551a05bb0e66386a797c23c1cbf49da6) - Cheap and easy to use Virtual Private Servers.  Their Linode Manager and great tutorials makes it fairly easy get setup quickly.  Higly recommended.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) - A powerful and fast web framework for Rust that uses a type-driven approach.  Requires nightly version of Rust, but all the good ones do.
- [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) - While I use Windows or [Pop! OS](https://system76.com/pop) for development I like the stability of Ubuntu for my server.

#### JavaScripts
I use several JavaScript libraries to enhance the look and interactivity of the site.  Here are the libraries that I use along with their licenses:
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - Syntax Highlighting for my code snippets.  I created a custom stylesheet to style Rust code snippets; the custom hljs style resembles my own personal Sublime Text theme.  Licensed under the BSD license.
- [TOC jQuery Plugin](https://ndabas.github.io/toc/) - I use this jQuery plugin to create a nice looking table of contents for article pages and static pages containing markdown.  Apache license.
- [fancyBox 3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) - fancyBox is a very cool library for displaying images and image galleries.  Works with mobile devices and touch screens.  GPLv3 license.
- [jQuery 3](https://jquery.com/) - I have found jQuery to be extremely useful.  It makes DOM manipulation, even previously complex cases, very easy.  MIT license.
- [Bootstrap ](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Even though this is CSS I put it here because it is the only CSS library I use, and it does have a JavaScript component.  MIT license.
- [Hljs Line Numbers](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js/) - A plugin for Highlight.js to wrap code snippets in a table that dispalys the line numbers.  MIT license.
- [Clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) - A nice little library to help copy text to the clipboard.  MIT license.
- [Remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) - Converts Markdown into HTML.  It has some nice features and works very well for my purposes.  MIT license.
- [jQuery Toast Plugin](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/jquery-toast-plugin) - Creates little notification messages.  Click the Copy button next to any code snippet to see.  MIT license.
