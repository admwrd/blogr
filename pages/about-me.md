## Me
I am a programmer and web developer living in Madison, WI.  I have experience with web/intranet app development and databases.  See [Website Details]({{base_url}}content/about-site) for a list of libraries and software I use for this website.

#### My Development Environment
- [My custom Sublime Text theme]({{base_url}}content/sublime-theme)
- <div class="img-wrap-center"><a data-fancybox="theme" href="{{base_url}}uploads/sublime-rust-theme.PNG"><img alt="My custom Rust theme for Sublime Text" src="{{base_url}}uploads/sublime-rust-theme.PNG"></a></div>
- [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) - An awesome terminal emulator for windows.  Just awesome.
    - [Here is a screenshot of my Cmder setup]({{base_url}}uploads/cmder.PNG)
    - <div class="img-wrap-center"><a data-fancybox="cmder" href="{{base_url}}uploads/cmder.PNG"><img alt="My console emulator setup" src="{{base_url}}uploads/cmder.PNG"></a></div>
    - You can see the original [background image here]({{base_url}}uploads/cmder-bg.png)
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - A free program for 3D modeling, animation, and game engine.  I used this to make the isosphere background used on content as well as the background I use for Cmder (see above).
- [Apophysis 7x](https://sourceforge.net/projects/apophysis7x/) - A fractal editor for windows.  A little buggy but I have created some cool fractals with it.  I used this to render all of the fractas on on this website.
- [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) - I was using Chrome but have switched back to Firefox.  Chrome was chrasing on my constantly.  Since Mozilla has been using and supporting Rust it seems like the obvious choice.

## Programming Languages
Most of my experience in the past has been with web development related languages.  I have picked up Rust in early 2017 and haven't stopped programming in it.  I intent to learn many languages, including Scala, Elixir, and Haskell.  All languages are listed in order of familiarity (most to least).

- #### More Experience
    - Rust
    - PHP
    - JavaScript
    - AutoHotKey
    - HTML / XML

- #### Little Experience
    - Python
    - C#
    - Java


### Experience
I have about 3 years of professional programming experience in PHP/HTML/JavaScript.  I have created websites and web apps for businesses and non-profits.  In college I logged over 120 hours of formal tutoring, and was often approached by fellow students for informal help.

## Database
I have used MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server professionally, and Oracle for all of my college classes.  I feel very comfortable using databases; writing queries (including complex joins), stored procedures, and full-text searches.  I have dabbled in NoSQL databases like CouchDB and Couchbase.

## Learning
Never stop learning/reading.  I would like to to get more experience working various technologies and softwares. I believe working more with NoSQL databases as well as using Redis or Varnish with Rust would be useful.  Also I am trying to write more unit tests.
#### Languages To Learn
- Scala
- Elixir
- TypeScript
- Haskell
