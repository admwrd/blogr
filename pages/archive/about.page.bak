description: The programs I use and what powers this website.
-----
<h1>What I Use</h1>
<p>My background is mainly in developing web applications and intranet applications.  I am proficient in HTML and CSS (and have just started using SASS). I program primarily in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a>, JavaScript, PHP.  I have done some programming in C++, C#, Python, VB, and Java.  Haskell is something I have played around with but would not yet consider myself proficient with.</p>
<p>I currently use Windows for everyday use.  Being a web programmer I am no stranger to linux and currently have use <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as my distro of choice.</p>
<h1>This Website</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a><br>
This website is run on a Ubuntu server using <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> as a reverse proxy to serve html files generated by my Rust web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a><br>
Nginx servers static files but all other requests go to the Rust application which uses the <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket web framework</a>.  I absolutely love Rocket.  It allows me to write web applications with a focus on traits and types/data structures.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a><br>
Rocket and Nginx both support TLS so using <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a> to encrypt the entire website was an easy decision.  It was easy to setup both Rocket and Nginx to use HTTPS.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=b0738c61551a05bb0e66386a797c23c1cbf49da6">Linode</a><br>
When it came time to deploy my Rust web app I needed to choose a VPS to host it.  Previously I have used shared hosting sites like SiteGround but in this case that wouldn’t work so my good friend recommended <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=b0738c61551a05bb0e66386a797c23c1cbf49da6">Linode</a>.  I have found it very easy to use and the prices very fair.  They have a fairly extensive collection of articles to help you setup webservers, use a domain name/subdomain, setup email, and secure your server.  The above links to Linode use my referral code.</p>
<h4>Markdown</h4>
<p>All of my blog articles are written in Markdown.  The nicest markdown editor I have found is <a href="http://pad.haroopress.com/">Haroopad</a> which I use to write my articles.</p>
<h1>IDE</h1>
<p>I use Sublime Text for programming.  It is my goto (pun intended) editor for Rust, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C++, and HTML/CSS files.</p>
<p>After trying many different themes without finding one that I felt was satisfying I decided to make my own.  After a few attempts I came up with a decent theme for Rust.</p>
<p>You can see a <a href="https://vishus.net/uploads/sublime-rust-theme.PNG">screenshot of the Rust Theme</a> I created and use daily, which can be <a href="https://vishus.net/uploads/Vishus-Rust-Sublime-Theme.tmTheme">downloaded here</a>.</p>
<h1>Databases</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a> is my RDBMS of choice for personal hobby projects.</p>
<p>I have also used and feel comfortable working with: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL.</p>
<p>For NoSQL databases I have played around with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">Apache CouchDB</a> and <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a> but have yet to use them for any significant project.</p>
<h1>Command Line</h1>
<p>About a year ago I start using <a href="http://cmder.net/">Cmder</a> (an awesome console emulator for Windows) and absolutely <em>LOVE IT</em>.<br>
<a href="https://vishus.net/uploads/cmder.PNG">Here is a screenshot of my Cmder setup</a><br>
You can see the <a href="https://vishus.net/uploads/cmder-bg.png">background image here</a></p>
<h1>Graphic Design</h1>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> for some simple 3D designs (like this <a href="https://vishus.net/uploads/cmder-bg.png">isosphere</a> that I use as my background for Cmder and this website).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paintshoppro.com/en/">PaintShopPro</a> is my favorite graphics editor, I have tried Photoshop but found certain parts of PSP just a little easier to work with for me.</p>
<p>For fractal images <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/apophysis7x/">Apophysis 7x</a> is my favorite.  It takes a little playing around with to master it (something I have not yet accomplished) but I find I can make some decent images.  The article header backgrounds were all generated using Apophysis.</p>
<h1>Internet</h1>
<p>I used to use Chrome.  Recently I swithced to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">Firefox Quantum</a> and have loved every second with Firefox.  After picking up Rust (which is also made by Mozilla) it feels good to also use Firefox.  I had used Chrome for a long time but after putting up with its frequent crashes and often excessive resource usage it was time to switch. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/firefox-ffe71d0e16c3">This article</a> lists a lot of the same reasons I switched to Firefox.</p>
<h1>Hex Editor</h1>
<p><a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">HxD</a> is easy to use and comes with some great features like opening a entire drives, viewing RAM, and secure file wiping.</p>
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p><a href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a><br>
Music is a must for many serious programmer.  I have been using <a href="https://getmusicbee.com/">MusicBee</a> ever since I stopped using Winamp.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html">SumatraPDF</a><br>
For ebooks I use <a href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html">SumatraPDF</a>.  It supports pdf’s, epub, djvu, mobi, epub, chm, and even comic book and fanfic files.  When I am trying to learn something I find ebooks to be essential, and sumatra makes it easy for me to flip my laptop screen over and read the ebook like I would on a tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cryptool.org/de/">CrypTool</a><br>
Security is important.  Using encryption tools can be difficult if you are like me and have mostly command line encryption tools.  I use <a href="https://www.cryptool.org/de/">CrypTool</a> when I need to play around with and convert the data first.  It is also an essential learning tool when trying to understand and learn how cryptography works.</p>
<p><a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a><br>
Automating tasks is a must for programmers with limited time.  I have been using <a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a> for many years.  I would highly recommend all Windows programmers learn a little AHK; it’s not hard to pick up and can do so many different tasks easily.</p>
