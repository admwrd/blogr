# About Me
My background is mainly in developing web applications and intranet applications.  I am proficient in HTML and CSS (and have just started using SASS). I program primarily in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), JavaScript, PHP.  I have done some programming in C++, C#, Python, VB, and Java.  Haskell is something I have played around with but would not yet consider myself proficient with.

I currently use Windows for everyday use.  Being a web programmer I am no stranger to linux and currently have use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) as my distro of choice.


# This Website
[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
This website is run on a Ubuntu server using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy to serve html files generated by my Rust web app.

[Rocket](https://rocket.rs/)
Nginx servers static files but all other requests go to the Rust application which uses the [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs/).  I absolutely love Rocket.  It allows me to write web applications with a focus on traits and types/data structures.

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
Rocket and Nginx both support TLS so using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to encrypt the entire website was an easy decision.  It was easy to setup both Rocket and Nginx to use HTTPS.

[Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=b0738c61551a05bb0e66386a797c23c1cbf49da6)
When it came time to deploy my Rust web app I needed to choose a VPS to host it.  Previously I have used shared hosting sites like SiteGround but in this case that wouldn't work so my good friend recommended [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=b0738c61551a05bb0e66386a797c23c1cbf49da6).  I have found it very easy to use and the prices very fair.  They have a fairly extensive collection of articles to help you setup webservers, use a domain name/subdomain, setup email, and secure your server.  The above links to Linode use my referral code.

#### Markdown
All of my blog articles are written in Markdown.  The nicest markdown editor I have found is [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) which I use to write my articles.

# IDE
I use Sublime Text for programming.  It is my goto (pun intended) editor for Rust, SQL, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C++, and HTML/CSS files.

After trying many different themes without finding one that I felt was satisfying I decided to make my own.  After a few attempts I came up with a decent theme for Rust.  

You can see a [screenshot of the Rust Theme](https://vishus.net/uploads/sublime-rust-theme.PNG) I created and use daily, which can be [downloaded here](https://vishus.net/uploads/Vishus-Rust-Sublime-Theme.tmTheme).

# Databases
[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) is my RDBMS of choice for personal hobby projects.

I have also used and feel comfortable working with: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL.

For NoSQL databases I have played around with [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/) but have yet to use them for any significant project.

# Command Line
About a year ago I start using [Cmder](http://cmder.net/) (an awesome console emulator for Windows) and absolutely *LOVE IT*.
[Here is a screenshot of my Cmder setup](https://vishus.net/uploads/cmder.PNG)
You can see the [background image here](https://vishus.net/uploads/cmder-bg.png)

# Graphic Design
I use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for some simple 3D designs (like this [isosphere](https://vishus.net/uploads/cmder-bg.png) that I use as my background for Cmder and this website).

[PaintShopPro](https://www.paintshoppro.com/en/) is my favorite graphics editor, I have tried Photoshop but found certain parts of PSP just a little easier to work with for me.

For fractal images [Apophysis 7x](https://sourceforge.net/projects/apophysis7x/) is my favorite.  It takes a little playing around with to master it (something I have not yet accomplished) but I find I can make some decent images.  The article header backgrounds were all generated using Apophysis.


# Internet
I used to use Chrome.  Recently I swithced to [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and have loved every second with Firefox.  After picking up Rust (which is also made by Mozilla) it feels good to also use Firefox.  I had used Chrome for a long time but after putting up with its frequent crashes and often excessive resource usage it was time to switch. [This article](https://hackernoon.com/firefox-ffe71d0e16c3) lists a lot of the same reasons I switched to Firefox.


# Hex Editor
[HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) is easy to use and comes with some great features like opening a entire drives, viewing RAM, and secure file wiping.

# Miscellaneous
[MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/)
Music is a must for many serious programmer.  I have been using [MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/) ever since I stopped using Winamp.

[SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)
For ebooks I use [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html).  It supports pdf's, epub, djvu, mobi, epub, chm, and even comic book and fanfic files.  When I am trying to learn something I find ebooks to be essential, and sumatra makes it easy for me to flip my laptop screen over and read the ebook like I would on a tablet.

[CrypTool](https://www.cryptool.org/de/)
Security is important.  Using encryption tools can be difficult if you are like me and have mostly command line encryption tools.  I use [CrypTool](https://www.cryptool.org/de/) when I need to play around with and convert the data first.  It is also an essential learning tool when trying to understand and learn how cryptography works.

[AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/)
Automating tasks is a must for programmers with limited time.  I have been using [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) for many years.  I would highly recommend all Windows programmers learn a little AHK; it's not hard to pick up and can do so many different tasks easily.
